# Automated-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Fake-Review-Detection-and-Rating-Predictions

# Problem Statement
**In today's digital age, online customer reviews have become a crucial aspect of business success, especially for e-commerce platforms and service providers. These reviews provide valuable insights into customer satisfaction, product quality, and service effectiveness. However, the vast volume of reviews makes it challenging for businesses to extract actionable insights manually. Additionally, fake reviews can distort perceptions, making it even harder to gauge genuine customer sentiment. Therefore, there is a need for an automated system to analyze customer reviews, detect fake reviews, and predict customer ratings based on review content.**


# Goals and Objectives
**The overarching objective of this project is to develop an automated, data-driven approach to understanding customer reviews. By analyzing sentiment, detecting fake reviews, and predicting ratings, the project aims to equip businesses with the insights needed to improve customer experiences, make informed decisions, and maintain the integrity of online review systems.**
